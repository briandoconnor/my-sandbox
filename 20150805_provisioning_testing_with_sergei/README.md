An effort to spin up more complex infrastructure than Youxia (CloudBindle) currently

See https://medvedev.io/blog/ for the tutorial I'm using in the hadoop directory.  I basically took this tutorial and adapted it to work on AWS from DigitalOcean.  See original git here: https://github.com/dimamedvedev/bosun-install-example
